An Introduction To StackForge
=============================

Abstract
--------

OpenStack is not only the fastest-growing open-source cloud project but
is also a large-scale, complex system with a rapidly expanding code base
and more than 1,000 contributors to date.  Handling the quantity and
pace of contributions is a huge challenge on its own.  We've been able
to handle the dramatic scale of development by having automation systems
that allow us to treat all developers equally from a process perspective
and keep our trunk always clean by performing testing pre-merge.  The
beautiful thing about this approach has been that it doesn't just keep
up with demands, it facilities and encourages more development.

The system is so good, in fact, that people want to use it to develop more
things than just OpenStack. StackForge is a self-service system that hosts
and manages unofficial projects related to OpenStack. This talk will walk
through getting started with StackForge.
