An outline of OpenStack CI components.

Abstract
--------
The OpenStack infrastructure project encompasses all of the systems
that are used in the day to day operation of the OpenStack project
as a whole. This includes development, testing and collaboration tools.
All of the source that we run is open source, and its configuration
is public.

This presentation will illustrate the main OpenStack components used
in our systems, and how they interact between each other.
