Gerrit Code Review Web Client Replacement (Vinz)
================================================

Presentation to sell the idea of a Gerrit UI replacement to Portland
State University computer science capstone students.

Projects a pitched and then selected by the students. This is the
initial portion of sponsoring a project. It must be pitched to the
students.

Basic idea is that the Gerrit web UI has many deficiencies. They
recognize this, but have replaced portions of the UI with new bits
that do little to address the deficiencies.

The change review screens and dashboard are the worst. Project proposal
here is to kick off the Vinz project by replacing both of these things
with a modern javascript application that uses to Gerrit REST API to
function. Basically Gertty for your web browser.
