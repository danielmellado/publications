Scaling OpenStack Development: Continuous Integration Overview
==============================================================

The OpenStack Grizzly release brought roughly 400,000 new lines of
source code in 10,000 changes from 500 developers over a 6-month period.

being merged into the official codebase. This presentation will provide
a high-level examination of the techniques used to coordinate and
automate software development efforts at such a scale.
