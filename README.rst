Help Wanted
===========

This presentation is designed for use with presentty_ in a minimum
80x24 character color terminal. System package and Python
dependencies are tracked in the bindep.txt and requirements.txt
files respectively. A tox.ini is included which checks your system
dependencies, installs the Python dependencies into a virtualenv and
runs the presentation automatically just by running `tox` in this
directory.
