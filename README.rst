Infra Project Update
====================

This presentation is designed for use with presentty_ in a minimum
80x24 character color terminal. System package and Python
dependencies are tracked in the bindep.txt and requirements.txt
files respectively. A tox.ini is included which checks your system
dependencies, installs the Python dependencies into a virtualenv and
runs the presentation automatically just by running `tox` in this
directory.

We will use this presentation to give Infrastructure project updates
at venues like OpenStack Summits. We will update this branch for
each iteration given. Presentations should be short in the ~20
minute range.
